## Design

**Problem.** pi's `/model` selector renders rows as `id [provider] ✓` with
no extension hook. We need to show per-model notes without forking the
selector.

**Mechanism (verified).** Mirror the technique used by `pi-model-selector-x`:
at extension load, dynamically import pi's own bundled
`modes/interactive/components/model-selector.js` (resolved from
`dirname(realpathSync(process.argv[1]))`), then wrap
`ModelSelectorComponent.prototype.updateList` so it calls the original and
then appends our annotation. Unpatch on `session_shutdown`.

**Display in `/model`.** Two parts, both inside the same patched `updateList`:
1. *Inline tag* on every annotated row (the row's `id` token is matched
   against the annotation map; the tag is auto-truncated to 40 chars so long
   notes don't break the row layout).
2. *Detail pane* under the list for the currently highlighted model
   (separator, `Annotations` label, full note). The model name + provider line
   was removed — the row above already shows them.

**Storage.** `~/.pi/agent/model-annotations.json`, keyed by `model.id`
(the id token shown in `/model` rows — consistent across the row regex
and `event.model.id`).

**Editor.** `/model-annotations` (no arguments) opens a single interactive
TUI component via `ctx.ui.custom`. A fuzzy-filtered list shows annotated
models sorted to the top (★ marker + `—  note` hint), then scoped-but-not-
annotated models (◆ marker), then the rest. A legend (`★ annotated  ◆ scoped`)
appears under the title. Enter opens an inline `Input` to edit/create the note
(prefilled if one exists; cursor at end). Ctrl+D triggers an inline confirm
prompt (y/n) to delete the annotation — `ctx.ui.confirm` cannot be used
because it destroys the custom component (see STATUS.md §5.8). Esc cancels
edit/confirm and returns to the list; Esc in the list exits. Empty+Enter in
edit = delete (if the text is empty after trim, there's nothing to lose).
The annotation JSON file is the scriptable surface for power-user automation
(`jq`, etc.) — there are no subcommands or command-line forms.

**Scoped models.** The extension `ctx` does not expose `session.scopedModels`
or `settingsManager`, so scoped models are determined by reading the
`enabledModels` patterns from settings.json (global + project override) and
glob-matching against `ctx.modelRegistry.getAvailable()`. This captures the
persistent Ctrl+P scope, not session-level `/scoped-models` runtime changes.
See STATUS.md §5.7.

**Footer widget.** Removed. An earlier version set a footer widget on
`model_select` showing `[model.id, note]`, but it rendered as two lines above
the editor after picking a model in `/model` — not useful. The `/model` inline
tags + detail pane are the only display surfaces.

## Branches
- `main` — canonical, receives pushes via `git push origin live:main`.
- `live` — the branch users install with `pi install ...@live`.

## Edit loop
1. Edit files on `live`.
2. `pi update --extensions` (or `/reload` for hot-reload) to pick up changes.
3. `git add` + `git commit` on `live`.
4. `git push origin live` to update the install branch; `git push origin live:main`
   to publish to `main`.
